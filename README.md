Climbing topos for Tahquitz
===========================

These are rock-climbing topos for climbs at Tahquitz. They're designed to be
printer-friendly and usable in black and white.

In most cases I've done the climb several times, tried
different variations, etc., but there is no guarantee that my
information is correct. If you find mistakes or have suggestions for
improvements, please contact me using the contact info at
http://www.lightandmatter.com/area4author.html , or post a comment on
mountainproject.

The whole thing can be downloaded as a single multi-page PDF file, from
[this link](http://lightandmatter.com/tahquitz/tahquitz.pdf).
I have also posted single pages for the individual climbs as images
on mountainproject, but those may become outdated as I make improvements.

You can buy it as a printed book [at lulu.com](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/benjamin_crowell).

I have a separate repository for photos and photo topos in color:

Climbing topos for Tahquitz
===========================

This is a collection of rock-climbing topos for Tahquitz. They're designed to be
printer-friendly and usable in black and white.
The whole thing can be downloaded as a single multi-page PDF file, from
[this link](https://lightandmatter.com/tahquitz/tahquitz.pdf). The complete
PDF has other features such as a description of the friction descent and
photo overviews of bigger areas of the rock.
I have also posted single pages for the individual climbs as images
on mountainproject, but those may become outdated as I make improvements.

Want to help? Send me your topo!
--------------------------------

So far, the book is complete for all widely recognized routes at Tahquitz
up to 5.6, but my coverage tapers off as you get into the 5.7 range, because
I don't lead that hard and don't get many opportunities to follow on harder
climbs. The project is done in the spirit of collaborative free information,
so it would be great if you could help me to add topos for harder climbs.
For example, you could hand-draw a topo, take a picture of it, and 
[email it to me](http://www.lightandmatter.com/area4author.html).
I can fancy it up and flesh out whatever text or description you can give me.

Corrections welcome
-------------------

In most cases I've done the climb several times, tried
different variations, etc., but there is no guarantee that my
information is correct. If you find mistakes or have suggestions for
improvements, please [contact me](http://www.lightandmatter.com/area4author.html), or post a comment on
mountainproject.

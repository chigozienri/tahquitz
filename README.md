Climbing topos for Tahquitz
===========================

These are rock-climbing topos for climbs at Tahquitz. They're designed to be
printer-friendly and usable in black and white.

In most cases I've done the climb several times, tried
different variations, etc., but there is no guarantee that my
information is correct. If you find mistakes or have suggestions for
improvements, please contact me using the contact info at
http://www.lightandmatter.com/area4author.html , or post a comment on
mountainproject.

The whole thing can be downloaded as a single multi-page PDF file, from
[this link](https://lightandmatter.com/tahquitz/tahquitz.pdf).
I have also posted single pages for the individual climbs as images
on mountainproject, but those may become outdated as I make improvements.

You can buy it as a printed book [at lulu.com](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/benjamin_crowell).

The book, including the drawings and photos, is under an open-source license,
so you can modify it or use it for your own purposes. If you come up with
a topo and route description for a climb that I haven't included, and you
want to let me include it here, that would be great. I can handle the formatting.

I have a separate repository for photos and photo topos in color:

\section{Climbing at Tahquitz Rock before World War II}

The recorded history of climbing at Tahquitz begins in 1936 when Jim Smith and Mary Jane Edwards, members of
the Rock Climbing Section of the Sierra Club's Los Angeles chapter, noticed Tahquitz Rock
as they descended from nearby Tahquitz Peak.
RCS later became separate from the Sierra Club for liability reasons and is now SCMA.

\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{figs/tahquitz_history}

The history of its development as a climbing area is recorded in the 1938-1940 issues of the newsletter Mugelnoos,
which has been scanned and preserved by SCMA and is available to members on its website.
The reproduction above shows the club's first attempt to make an organized record of first ascents,
which previously had been reported in the newsletter as they occurred. Most of the members were mainly
interested in ski mountaineering, hence the title of the newsletter.

Because rock climbing was at this time simply a technique used in mountaineering, rather than a sport
in its own right, the attitude was that any way of getting up the rock was fair game, and many of the
early first ascents were probably done by aiding on pitons whenever it was convenient. With the primitive ropes, gear, and belaying
techniques of the period, a fall at a crux would have been serious. Pitons were left in place ``for safety'' on
Fingertip Traverse, were routinely used as aid on Angel's Fright, and were put in place on rappel in order to
facilitate the first ascent of Piton Pooper. Many of these pitons are still in place.

The club began training people in roped climbing and belaying, sometimes at Stoney Point, Strawberry Peak, and Eagle Rock.
The route now known as the Friction Descent was originally discovered in June 1938 by Jim Smith, was labeled
the Friction Route, and was also used for training. People normally climbed on the west side of the rock and rappelled
back down rather than down-climbing, so there was not much interest in the descent routes we use today.

Everything to the left of the Maiden Buttress was unclimbed as of 1940, although there had been several attempts to find routes.
Suicide Rock was not even scouted as a climbing area until 1940 (Mugelnoos No.~66), and was considered unclimbable
because of the steep slabs and lack of protection. The first recorded FA at Suicide was not until 1955
(Paisano Jam Crack). In general, the only artificial pro was thin pitons, so the selection of routes
was extremely limited.

\section{Weather and Climbing Season}

\begin{wrapfigure}[16]{r}{0.35\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/snow-satellite}
\caption{Snow on (a) May 1, 2022, (b) May 15, 2022.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Climbing season usually begins in late March on the south side, but snow may
linger into May on the north side. The picture shows how to get a decent guess
about conditions based on a satellite image. 
Figure (a) shows a date when the north side still had snow inside a few alcoves and
crevices, visible through binoculars. From the satellite, you can see that there
is snow in the north-facing gullies on the ridge connecting Tahquitz Rock to
Tahquitz Peak; (b) is two weeks later, when the rock itself was completely free
of snow, but there were two small snow piles at the bottom of the Larks, barely
visible here as tiny dots.

Many years, for most of the summer, the forecast is for a 20\% chance of showers. Waiting for
the number to go to 0\% could mean not climbing all summer.
A forecast of 85 F in Idyllwild, or 100 F in Riverside,
usually means it will be hotter than optimal. I usually drink less water
than most people, but in these conditions I would bring 2 liters of water
on a climb. In midsummer, even the north face is sun-exposed all day.

The end of the season is usually around Thanksgiving.
If checking the weather forecast for Idyllwild, keep in mind that the
town is at 5400', while the summit of Tahquitz Rock is at 7973'. As a
rule of thumb, temperatures on north-facing routes will feel colder by
20 degrees F than the forecast in Idyllwild.

In early or late season,
if the forecast for Idyllwild is a low of 45 F and a high of 65 F,
this generally means that early-morning climbing on the north side
will be a test of fortitude. In these conditions, think about gloves,
long underwear, and multiple layers of wool and down. Unfortunately
the only part of the rock that receives early-morning sun is the area
around the Ski Tracks, where there are only a few moderate trad
routes.

\section{Ratings}

\subsection{Historical}

The Yosemite Decimal System originated at Tahquitz, and the following
climbs were used as the standards to define the scale. For each climb, I've also listed the
consensus rating from Mountainproject (in 2015), which shows that there has been
quite a bit of inflation in the ratings over the years, mainly at the low end of the
scale --- nobody wants to say they climb 5.0 these days.

\begin{mytable}{Historical definition of the YDS, and inflation of ratings}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
5.0 & The Trough                        & FA 1936 & modern  5.4 \\
5.1 & Fingertip Traverse                & FA 1936 & modern  5.4 \\
5.2 & Frightful Variation of the Trough & FA 1944 & modern  5.2 \\
5.3 & East Lark                         & FA 1950 & modern  5.5 \\
5.4 & Angel's Fright                    & FA 1936 & modern  5.5 \\
5.5 & Ski Tracks                        & FA 1947, 1957 & modern  5.6, 5.9 \\
5.6 & Sahara Terror                     & FA 1942 & modern  5.7 \\
5.7 & Fingertrip                        & FA 1946 & modern  5.7 \\
5.8 & Mechanic's Route                  & FA 1937 & modern  5.8R \\
5.9 & Open Book                         & FFA 1952 & modern  5.9
\end{tabular}
\end{mytable}

\subsection{Evaluating ratings from a guidebook}

When depending on a guidebook for information about the difficulty of a climb, take
into account both the popularity of the climb and the date of its first ascent.
Old and lesser-known climbs often retain their historical ratings, which can be
extremely sandbagged by modern standards.

For example,
Summit magazine did a big spread on Tahquitz in 1960, which you can find scans of online.
They describe Northeast Farce as 5.3 and White Maiden's Walkway as 5.1. Having done
these two climbs, I would agree that Northeast Farce is a couple of grades harder
than the Maiden. But the 2001 edition
of the Vogel-Gaines guidebook rates these climbs as 5.3 and 5.4, respectively --- as if
the Maiden were the \emph{harder} climb. What has
probably happened is that because the Maiden is one of the most popular climbs on
the rock, there has been pressure to inflate its rating. Since almost nobody does Northeast
Farce, it retains the rating that was assigned when it was first climbed in 1954.

Another good example of this phenomenon is two obscure climbs on the inaccessible
south face of Suicide Rock, named Minor and Spring Cleaning. The first ascent of Minor is
lost in the mists of time, while Spring Cleaning had its FA in 1970. Several people who
I've done these climbs with agree that they are equal in difficulty, but Vogel and Gaines
list them as 5.1 and 5.6.

\section{Descent routes}

\subsection{Friction descent}\label{subsec:friction-descent}

FA June 23, 1938, Jim Smith. This was originally used as a training route for new members of the
Sierra Club's Rock Climbing Section.

This is the class 3 standard descent for routes that end on the low western shoulder of the rock.
Most of these routes end below the friction descent, but some, such as White Maiden's Walkaway,
end above it. People have been known to get lost or in trouble on this descent, and some people
don't feel comfortable doing it unroped. An alternative is always to go up and over
the top of the rock, and then down either the north gully or the climber's trail on the
south side of the rock.

Locate the house-sized boulder near the top of Tahquitz Rock's western shoulder,
perched above the south side of the rock. Pass around the boulder on either the
east or the west side, and go to the east side of the boulder. Insert into a short vertical chimney
with one wall formed by a second, lower boulder. The exit at the bottom of the chimney is a big step
onto a sloping ledge. This move can be done either by hugging the back wall and stepping down to
a tree or by hanging your butt farther out in the wind and feeling for an undercling on the right.

Go down a ramp to the east, then follow a ledge west to a tree. Using a chock-stone for
stability, insert into a diagonal chimney. At the bottom of the chimney, take a ledge down to
the east.

The remainder of the route is a traverse passing through 
two wooded islands in the slabs. Each of these islands has two tall pine trees and some oak scrub.
One of the trees in the first island is dead. The pine trees in the second island are a double tree.
In the first island, pass directly through the grotto formed by the oaks.

Continue traversing across exposed slabs until you reach the dirt.

\includegraphics[width=100mm]{figs/friction_descent}

Return to Lunch Rock on a use trail. This trail can become indistinct in spots,
and it is easy to be tempted into false alternatives that lead into dense
brush. The correct trail runs parallel to and just a few feet left of the
edge of the exposed granite. In most places the edge of the granite means the base
of the rock wall, but in two spots it means the edge of some low-angle
slabs. Stay off of these slabs, one set of which lies
below the friction descent
and another near the bottom of the Ski Tracks.

After passing the second set of slabs,
continue around the corner and back to Lunch Rock.

\pagebreak

\subsection{North Gully descent}\label{subsec:north-gully-descent}

This class 2 descent route is used by climbs that end near the top of the rock
or to its east. If coming down from the summit, scramble down class 3
rock to the saddle lying between the summit of Tahquitz Rock and
Tahquitz Peak. However, most of the climbing routes that use this descent end below and to
the east of the summit, and for these routes the traverse to the saddle is no more than
class 2.

The normal North Gully descent, described here, goes down the gully to the north of the saddle.
If there has been wet weather recently, it may be faster and safer to go down the south side
instead.

If using the standard North Gully descent, then from the saddle, turn
left down a steep, rough trail.  Descend low-angle slabs on the right,
not class 5 slabs on the left.  (If there has been wet weather
recently, the slabs may be covered with water, forcing you to
downclimb along the ramp and east-facing dihedral to the west of the
slabs.)  The slabs lead down to a big ledge. Rather than continuing
down further slabs below the ledge, make a sharp left around a corner.

Below the slab area, a use trail resumes. This trail
stays right for a while, no more than 100 feet from the rock face of
the Strawberry Creek headwall. It then forks, one fork leading left through the
talus field and the other on dirt. The right-hand fork is easier as a descent route.

The trail now gradually becomes more obvious and well maintained, paralleling the creek and passing through
a grove of oaks.
Continue to the upper parking lot at Humber Park.

\section{Natural History}

\subsection{Trees and Shrubs}

Here are about a dozen of the most common species you will see on the
approach hike, climb, and descent. Species are arranged in groups from
least to most specialized. The symbol $\star$ means that this plant is
commonly seen on the rock itself.

\begin{wrapfigure}[9]{r}{0.4\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/oak_leaves}
\caption{Oak leaves.}
\end{wrapfigure}

\emph{South side trail, dry, sun-exposed slopes:}

\begin{itemize}
\item live oak (\emph{Q.~chrosyolepis} and \emph{wislizeni}) --- small, tough leaves
\item sugar pine (\emph{P.~Lambertiana}) $\star$ --- 1-3" needles in groups of 5. Almost all of the pine trees seen on climbing routes are these.
\item Coulter pine (\emph{P.~coulteri}) --- 6-7" needles in groups of 3, huge cones; less common
\item manzanita (\emph{Arctostaphylos}) --- smooth red bark, small pink bell-shaped flowers
\item mountain whitethorn (\emph{Ceanothus}) --- bushes with thorns; less common than at higher elevations

\end{itemize}

\emph{In addition, on the north side:}

\begin{itemize}
\item white fir (\emph{Abies concolor}) --- 1" single needles. Occasionally seen on climbing routes.
\item black oak (\emph{Q.~kelloggii}) --- large, soft leaves, deeply lobed with three-pointed tips
\item incense cedar (\emph{Calocedrus decurrens}) --- scaly leaves
\end{itemize}

\begin{wrapfigure}[7]{r}{0.15\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/currant_leaf}
\caption{Mountain pink currant.}
\end{wrapfigure}

\emph{In addition, in wet areas:}

\begin{itemize}
\item mountain pink currant (\emph{Ribes nevadense}) $\star$ --- bush or small tree with 3-lobed, serrated leaves
\item western azalea (\emph{Rhododendron occidentale})
\end{itemize}


\emph{Growing only out of cracks in the rock face:}

\begin{itemize}
\item mountain mahogany (\emph{Cercocarpus ledifolius}) $\star$ --- These are the small hardwoods you see on climbing routes,
       often used as anchors.
\end{itemize}

The 1974 Wilts guidebook notes a single lodgpole pine on East Lark.

Sources: Dole and Rose, \textbf{An Amateur Botanist's Identification Manual for
the Shrubs and Trees of the Southern Californoia Coastal Region and Mountains}.
Tom Chester, ``Plant Guide to Devils Slide Trail, San Jacinto Mountains,''
\url{tchester.org/sb/plants/guides/devils_slide.html}. The arrangement above
is what I came up with based on hiking the approach trail from Humber Park
to the vicinity of the Ski Tracks.

\subsection{Birds}

In the spring while hiking in on the approach,
you will hear a lot of \includegraphics{figs/chickadee-song}. This is the song of an adult
male mountain chickadee, \emph{Parus gambeli}, looking for someone with whom to mate for life. This three-note version seems to be what the birds in this
area consider sexy, not the four-note version of some other areas. I've always heard them
but not seen them, but they're
small grayscale birds with black throats and white eyebrows. They live in pine trees year-round, eating
insects in the summer and in the colder months resorting to pine nuts, insect eggs, and dormant insects.
They nest in holes in trees.

While climbing, once in a while something goes whooshing past my head. I think these are violet-green
swallows, \emph{Tachycineta thalassina}. Swallows hunt insects while flying, so probably that's what they're doing.
While sightseeing from a belay, you will also see the playful aerobatics of ravens, \emph{Corvus corax}.

\subsection{Geology}

The San Jacinto Mountains are geologically similar to the Sierra, and
that's the reason that the rock quality at Tahquitz tends to be so
much better than in the San Gabriels and San Bernardinos.  Both the
San Jacintos and the Sierra were formed by upwellings of magma, called
batholiths, that cooled and hardened deep underground rather than erupting
at the surface like a volcano.  The intrusion that formed Tahquitz happened about 100
million years ago, during the age of the dinosaurs. The San Jacintos
are at the north end of their batholith, the south end being at the
other end of the Peninsular Ranges, in Baja California.

Because the magma was still underground when it cooled, the cooling
process was very slow, taking about a million years to complete, so
there was time for large quartz and feldspar crystals to grow. These large crystals
are what give rocks like granite their granular texture. The rock in
the San Jacintos is quartz diorite, which is similar to granite but
contains a different proportion of quartz to other minerals.

On the west side of the San Jacintos lies the San Jacinto fault zone, which
runs from San Bernardino to the Salton Sea. The fault is active, and caused
major destruction in the area around Hemet in 1899 and 1918. The
mountains were uplifted by tectonic action along this fault line and
others to the east. 

Unlike the Sierra, the San Jacintos were never subject to glaciation during the Ice
Age and Little Ice Age, the southernmost
glaciers in California being in the San Bernardinos. This is why Tahquitz lacks the
glacial features seen in the Sierra such as cirques, U-shaped glacial valleys,
glacial aretes, and erratics.

\begin{wrapfigure}[10]{r}{0.4\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/exfoliation}
\caption{Overlaps on the northeast face.}
\end{wrapfigure}

The rounded rock face of Tahquitz was formed by processes similar to the ones
that created the domes of Yosemite. Pressure underneath caused the rock to expand,
and the faster expansion near the surface caused the rock to bulge outward.
Fragile slabs about 100 feet thick then broke off of the outer part of the shell, like peeling
the outer layers of an onion. This shedding process, called exfoliation,
produced the smooth and rounded shape of the rock.
On a smaller scale, exfoliation of thin slabs continues today. In the photo,
it has created the ``overlaps'' that are natural obstacles on some of the climbing
routes on the northeast face.

<% climb("Angel's Fright","5.5",stars:3) %>

\topo{0.45}{angels_fright}

This short climb was the original definition of 5.4 on the YDS.
The name is a pun on Angels Flight in LA. P1 and P2 were traditionally
aided using pitons.
The long, uniform left-facing dihedral (P2) is prominent
from Humber Park. Fun, varied climbing.
The start is above and to the left of Lunch Rock. Pro to 2". FA (with aid?)
Sep.~20, 1936, Jim Smith and William Rice.

% re aid:
% https://www.mountainproject.com/edit/forum-message/0?replyToId=120631849&quoteId=120692650

% Most of the following is duplicated in The Frightful Variation of the Trough

\pitch{1} Climb a chimney with a crack on the right that starts as wide
hands and then becomes narrower.  Use crack technique. The
start is made easier by trusting the firmly lodged first chock-stone.
Well protected. Optional belay at a large ledge with trees; using this belay
makes it easier for the belayer to see what to do on the following, more
difficult section. Head up balancy, steep face climbing with
possibly bewildering routefinding. Start up a ragged crack, then
exit right to a small ledge with a fixed pin (replaced ca.~2020).
Move back left on the same ledge and feel for a hidden hold at head height.
Go up to a second piton. Climb to the right up a ramp to a big belay
ledge with two trees. 30 m

\pitch{2} Cruise up the big dihedral that forms the backbone of the
climb. A finger-width crack runs along the wall.  Most of the climbing
is easy 5th class, until you reach a vertical headwall.
The headwall has good hands, good pro, and an opportunity to rest at
a ledge on the right. After the headwall, continue
up fourth-class ledges to Lunch Ledge.  Here the climb joins up with Fingertip
Traverse and Fingertrip. 55 m

%%% Pitches 3-4 are duplicated as pitches 5-6 of Fingertip Traverse and also in Fingertrip.

\pitch{3} Climb up around a corner to the right (5.2) and
continue up fourth-class terrain.

\variation{1} Head up and left toward a dead tree, then
up and right along a ramp/crack. This variation works if you want to
link up P3-4 without excessive rope drag.

\pitch{4} Move up and left on a flake and then tiptoe along it as it
continues around a corner.  This is easily protected with 0.3"-1"
cams. A few feet beyond a small
tree, head 10 vertical feet up a 5.5 pure-friction slab to an orange bolt. (The slab
is steeper directly above the tree.) Beyond the bolt, the slab gets
less steep and there is pro. 

\variation{2} Head right into a low-angle gutter, then turn left at an overhang.
Rope drag tends to be a problem.
Where the wall ends, take care to route the rope so it doesn't snag under the
corner. 57 m, 5.1

\variation{3} Climb a very thin finger crack, punctuated with pin scars. 5.6

\upfriction
%=====================================================================

<% climb("Coffin Nail","5.8",stars:1) %>

\topo{0.35}{coffin_nail}

\warn{I've only done P2 once, and I didn't lead it.}

This is a more difficult variation of Jensen's Jaunt, differing in P1-2.
There is dangerous loose rock on the easy first pitch.
The second pitch is sustained and difficult and for the grade, but has excellent pro.
On weekends there tend to be traffic jams where
Jensen's Jaunt, Coffin Nail, and Traitorhorn all intersect.

Pro to 3-4". Bring plenty of hand- and finger-size gear.
White tricam for P4.
The FA is unknown.

From Lunch Rock, head around to the foot of the southwest end of the
rock.  The start of the climb lies in the general area to the right of
Fingertip Traverse and to the left of the gigantic right-facing
dihedral of Open Book.  
Starting from the trail, scramble up to a start at a wooded ledge.

\somespace

\pitch{1} Climb through an oak tree and then straight up toward a pine.
This initial section is 4th class except for one difficult move near a loose dead tree.
Enter a deep gully with a narrower chimney at the back. 5.3 climbing stiffening to
5.6. Beware of multiple loose rocks in this section, including one the size of
a gallon of milk and one the size of a microwave. It's possible to belay higher or
lower than the position shown on the topo.

\pitch{2} Strenuous hand jamming gets you out of the chimney (first crux).
Hand-width climbing and then easier finger widths. There is one good rest stance
along the way. The dihedral leans right and becomes overhanging. Layback
this section and protect with 1" cams. The second crux is to escape the
overhang at the upper left corner. It can be protected as much as desired
with finger-width gear. For the initial move, it helps if you know how
to do a finger lock and can do a one-arm pull-up. If necessary, the crux
can easily be aided. After the crux, continue up easy terrain to a belay (small gear)
below and to the left of the Traitorhorn overhang. 5.8+

% Descriptions of P3-5 are duplicated for Coffin Nail.

\pitch{3} Move up and around to the left, to an attention-getting
step-around move, which is made easier by taking a step down. The move
can be protected with small gear. After the step-around comes an
awkward crux move in order to get your right foot into a diagonal crack, with
a solid right hand but a sketchy left foot. The initial position is sort of
like the Winnie the Pooh story where Pooh gets his head stuck in
Rabbit's burrow.  Shorter leaders will have to do a little scooching
to get to the good hold. It's important to place pro immediately
before this move (red BD hex) in order to avoid the risk of a fall that hits a
boulder below.  Once you start squirming into position,
you can also reach forward to place another piece (a 4" cam works best,
but decent 2" or 3" placements exist).  Follow the crack, which
immediately widens and becomes off width.  The climbing soon becomes
easier, leading to a big, comfy, shady belay ledge at a mountain
mahogany. 5.6

\pitch{4} This pitch involves escaping and surmounting the big
left-facing dihedral by going around to the right and getting up onto
a ramp of slab that separates the area above Lunch Ledge from Open
Book. Climb class 4 blocks to an optional belay, which helps to avoid
rope drag. Traverse all the
way right to the arete above Open Book. A white tricam in the right
orientation can be made to fit in a tiny pin scar along the way,
providing at least psychological pro. Run-out 5.0 slab climbing along
the arete leads toward a crack. A single 5.5 move is required in order
to reach a good hold and place gear (0.75-2" cam).  Continue up a
low-angle fist crack, 5.0. Natural anchor at a boulder.   55 m

\variation{1} Climb the dihedral and then insert into the 5.1 gutter above Lunch Ledge.
I haven't tried this variation, but Vogel calls it 5.7, and it's supposed to protect well.

<% climb("East Lark","5.6") %>

\topo{0.25}{east_lark}

This route was the original standard for 5.3 in the YDS. It follows 
the most natural and obvious line up the north face, a long right-facing dihedral
system that jumps back and forth to the left and 
right. After this, most of the second half of the climb is a slog up a
nondescript face that mostly lacks cracks for pro or routefinding.

Because the dihedral zigzags so much, it is difficult to do long pitches without rope drag.
Beginners lured by the 5.5 rating in the Vogel-Gaines guidebook may find themselves
taking much, much longer than expected to get up this climb, which is long and
has a uniform 5.6 level of difficulty on pitches 3-7.

Although it's two YDS grades harder than
West Lark, an advantage of this climb over West Lark is that 
if you fall you're less likely to hit a ledge.

Rock quality is similar to most climbs on the north side.  Check holds
and gear placements for loose blocks and flakes.
The very top of var 2 has a lot of breadbox-size blocks that could be
deadly if dislodged.

FA Chuck and Ellen Wilts, G.~ Harr, and B.~Tory, 1950.

Protection to 2". Doubles of 0.5-1" cams
will be helpful.

The start lies at  the extreme right side of the north face, just to
the left of the north buttress. The gendarme and dead tree near the top are the most
visible landmark through the treetops. 
Approach via the North Side Trail, going all
the way to the east side of the face,
and then take a side trail back to the west along the face of the rock.
The start can be located by looking for the distinctive arch
on the right, and the big hexagonal flake.

\pitch{1} Climb the crack that runs along the left side of the
hexagonal flake, then traverse left along ledges to the right-facing dihedral.

\pitch{2} Continue up the dihedral. Belay at a ledge next to a mountain mahogany. 5.5

\pitch{3} Climb up and around a flake. Short pitch due to rope drag. 5.5

\pitch{4} Traverse down across a face with good hands and feet, inserting into
a big right-facing dihedral. Climb past a distinctive needle's eye formation.

This is a long climb that starts by following the corner on the right
side of the north buttress and eventually passes onto the crest of the
buttress. Large belay ledges make this a good route for climbing in a
larger group.  The rock quality is excellent.  The pitches vary in
difficulty.  Pitches 3 and 5 are the hardest, and they mostly
offer abundant pro, although less so in the final section of
pitch 5. Approach via either the Lunch Rock Trail or the North Gully Trail,
making sure not to confuse the North Buttress with the Maiden Buttresss,
which should be visible to the right.

``ant tree.'' Anchor below the lower trunk to avoid stirring up
the ants. 30 m, 4th class.

\pitch{2} Climb the ant tree. Don't stick your hands inside the holes in
the trunk, because one of them is an ant nest. Don't be too slow. If you
smell an odor like bathroom cleanser, it means the ants have sent out
an alarm and will soon be all over you.
As you get higher in the tree, protect by slinging a branch and
also with a 0.3" cam (blue Metolius) in a small
finger crack. For the easiest move onto the rock, 
stand on the very top of the tree and get a solid 2" cam in.

Near its top is a 10-foot section for which laybacking (5.5) is the

The original standard for 5.7 on the Yosemite Decimal
Scale. The initial hard sections of the climb are a lot easier if you mix up the laybacking
with stemming and jamming.
The name is a take-off on the neighboring Fingertip Traverse, the most memorable
sections of the two climbs being their traverses, which run parallel to each other.
Fingertrip's traverse, the more difficult of the two, follows
an arching overhang. Pro to 2".
FA Chuck Wilts, Don Gillespie, and Jerry Rosenblatt, 1946.

In 2019 and 2021, overconfident or inexperienced leaders were injured
on P1, which is a zigzagging dihedral that offers some chance of hitting something
if you fall. In the 2019 accident, which resulted in serious injuries, the leader
depended on a series of nuts that weren't fully extended, and failed to clip the fixed pin.
P2-3 are inherently safer because once you get into the arch there is nothing to hit in a fall.

From Lunch Rock, go right.
Before a steep section of the trail are the landmarks shown on the topo: a tall pine
tree, a red stain, and a dead log.

\somespace

\pitch{1} Layback and stem up a left-facing dihedral. An old fixed pin marks the
beginning of a cruxy section, but this section is not as hard as it looks from
underneath, because some handholds reveal themselves as you climb. The pin should
be backed up with gear. Later, to go at the grade, the climb detours left
along a 0.75" crack, then back right on a ledge. 5.7, 55 m.

\pitch{2} Scramble up easy blocks. After this is a section where you can get in
as much pro as you want. Traverse a less well protected slab. Stay underneath the overlaps.
Step around a corner into the arch. Climb the arch by stemming, laybacking, and jamming.
The initial section of the arch is easy and provides some good rest stances.
There are cam placements in a variety of sizes, mostly about 0.5 to 1".
The most comfortable spot for the hanging belay is at the
spot where the arch starts to angle over.
5.6, 35 m.

\pitch{3} The remaining section of the arch is more difficult due to the more severe
angle and the lack of good feet. Escape through the weak point in the overhang at the apex
of the arch. Move past a spot where a horn provides a helpful handhold and there is a mahogony
farther to the left. Continue to a large, low-lying tree at the top of Fingertip Traverse's
namesake feature. After this, the climbing becomes 4th class broken terrain leading up and
left to  Lunch Ledge. 5.7, $\sim$ 40 m.

\topo{0.27}{fools_rush}

This seldom-climbed route starts inside a hidden alcove between two
colossal staircases on the right side of the Maiden Buttress. Over in
the middle of the buttress there is a different square alcove, on a
less titanic scale, which is not the one you want. P1-3 are mostly lousy,
so the lovely P4 is best done as a link-up with White Maiden's Walkway.

A traverse (``From Bad Traverse'') is also possible from The Trough, but
I haven't done it. This starts from just below the
first belay (sloping ledge) on the Trough. A photo on the mountainproject page for Fools
Rush shows the traverse.

The rock quality on pitches 1-3 is worse than on other nearby routes.
Belay 1 is covered with loose rocks.
It would be a bad idea to climb this route below another party.
There is some choss and brush. 

It's not hard to see where the route goes in general, but finding the right small-scale line
is often difficult, and mistakes lead into harder climbing or sketchier pro. To use the most
comfortable belays, a 70 meter rope is helpful. The route description here
is for a 70 m rope and refers to the belays marked with black circles.
In white circles, I've marked additional or alternative belays that I
think would work with a 60 m rope. With a 60 m rope, careful planning
and accurate routefinding are necessary in order to avoid extremely awkward
belays sitting in bushes or trees.

Approach via the Lunch Rock Trail. Turn left next to Lunch Rock, a little
below the actual base of the rock. The gargantuan right-facing dihedral
is extremely obvious visually. A hidden ledge comes in from the right.

Pro to 3". FA Omar Conger, Barbara Lilley, and Don Rappolee, 1959.

\pitch{1} Climb a crack system and belay at a
ledge the size of a dining room, next to a fir and an oak. If using a 60 m
rope, it probably works to end this pitch a little higher, at one of the two
small ledges above the trees, so as to make the second pitch short enough. 45 m, 5.4

\pitch{2} Head up a low-angle, brushy crack from the left side of the ledge. (Don't climb the OW chimney farther left up against the
wall, or the face next to the OW, which is reputed to be 5.8.)
The climbing gets steeper, and there is a crux where the route goes up through a chimney
next to an overhang.  Continue up and left to a ledge below an oak tree. 63 m, 5.6

\pitch{3} Bushwhack through the oak tree's branches on the right and
insert into the big right-facing dihedral. (The face farther to the right of the tree is worse.) There is an obvious
weakness where a horn and a notch interrupt the wall of the dihedral. Landmarks for locating
the notch include a dead log straight above it, and a guillotine overhang above and to the
right.  Exit the dihedral by
climbing the wall's steep face. Above the notch is a comfortable saddle.
20 m, 5.6

\variation{1} I haven't tried this variation, which Vogel describes as
one YDS grade harder.  A climber who tried it tells me that the crack
in the corner of the dihedral gets less than finger width and too small to take gear, so he gave up
before the bush and escaped left where there was easier climbing at a
large flake.  Vogel seems to describe climbing through
the bush and then exiting where the dihedral dies out. A narrow ramp
higher up on the wall may be helpful.

\pitch{4} Enjoyable, well protected face climbing on excellent rock.
With a 60 m rope, it will be necessary to build a hanging belay somewhere in the middle.
Most of the climbing is 5.4, but there is a more difficult section in the middle that starts
at a left-facing dihedral. It works to place pro in the dihedral and then exit onto the easy
slab to the right, but this seemed hard for the grade, so there may be an easier line.
After the dihedral is a section that can be climbed either in
a crack to the left or a chimney to the right, both about 5.6-7.
Continue up to an area where the climbing
becomes more low-angle and the Maiden again
intersects the route. 68 m

into a cave formed by a claustrophobic overhang.
Escape the cave by moving out onto a slab, approaching

Mantle over the wall as far to the
right as possible.

the belay. The crux is the awkward second gap, 5.8.

This is not really a variation of The Trough --- all they have in common

be compared with The Trough, which was the standard for 5.0.
The start is above and to the left of Lunch Rock. Pro to 2".

\pitch{1} The climb starts with the initial section of Angel's Fright.
This is a chimney with a crack on the right that starts as wide
hands and then becomes narrower.  Climb using crack technique. The
start is made easier by trusting the firmly lodged first chock-stone.
Well protected. 5.3

\pitch{2} Traverse a big ledge to another chimney, this one filled with
flakes up to the size of a big tabletop. Carefully consider holds and
gear placements, since some of the flakes may be loose. A hand/finger crack
runs up the back of the chimney, but big holds make it unnecessary to use crack
technique to get up the steep part. 5.2

\pitch{3} Traverse left and then climb a staircase/dihedral. 5.2

\variation{1} Go up immediately from the belay. I haven't tried this
variation. Vogel calls it 5.6

\pitch{4} Traverse left along an undercling and then make a cruxy 5.6 move
up through a gap between a pair of overlaps. Bushwhack across a
ledge. Easy climbing except for the crux.

\pitch{5} Continue to pine tree ledge. 4th class

\variation{2} Climb a flaring crack from the right side of the brushy ledge,
then traverse left across slab. 5.7

\pitch{6} Climb a face a couple of feet to the right of the pine tree,
aiming for the small oak tree that is visible against the sky. It's
difficult to find gear placements here that aren't cracks behind
flakes, but it is possible to sling a series of tiny trees. The slope
moderates and turns into a gully. Beyond the oak tree is a short
section of easy climbing which ends at a huge pine tree. 55 meters,

The three middle pitches offer sustained climbing at the grade,
punctuated with some moves harder than people today expect on a 5.6.
The hard moves are all well protected.  Grade inflation has caused
guidebooks to lump together some much easier climbs such as Angel's
Fright and Left Ski Track into the same grade with this climb. The
bottom pitches are shared with Traitor Horn, the final ones with Coffin
Nail and On the Road. On weekends there tend to be traffic jams where
all these climbs intersect.  Pro to 3-4".  White tricam for P5.
FA Carl Jensen, Jim Smith, and Don
McDonald, 1938. Chuck Wilts's guidebook says that the route was first
climbed because someone fell off of the Traitor Horn route and decided
to go around rather than reattempting the horn. 

From Lunch Rock, head around to the foot of the southwest end of the
rock.  The start of the climb lies in the general area to the right of
Fingertip Traverse and to the left of the gigantic right-facing
dihedral of Open Book.  More nearby are two short right-facing walls
at about the same height as the first belay.  One of these walls is to
the left (first belay of Coffin Nail) and one to the right (start of
Turbo Flange).  From the trail, it is easy to identify the red-brown
stain, the kidney-shaped flake, and the imposing overhangs of
Traitor Horn, the latter seeming more prominent and higher up than they
actually are.  Starting from the trail a little to the left of the
route, scramble up to a start at a wooded ledge.

\somespace

% Descriptions of P1-3 are duplicated for Traitor Horn.
% Descriptions of P4-6 are duplicated for Coffin Nail.

\pitch{1} Climb through an oak tree and then traverse
easy terrain to a belay near an oak tree.  4th class, 20 m

\pitch{2} Climb a thin/balancey face with a cruxy spot 10' above the tree.
Head up with the goal of getting on top of the right-facing
dihedral formed by the top edge of the kidney-shaped flake. 
Pass up through an alcove. The escape from the alcove is strenuous
for the grade but easy to protect. Belay right above the alcove. (Belaying
inside it is cramped and awkward for the start of the next pitch.)
P2 and P3 can be linked up if desired. 37 m, 5.6

\pitch{3} Climb a crack that leads up and left, narrowing from fists to hands. Easy climbing
is followed by a steeper section.  Continue to the lower
left corner of the Traitor Horn overhangs. Belay (small gear) on a spacious
slope. 28 m, 5.6

\pitch{4} Move up and around to the left, to an attention-getting
step-around move, which is made easier by taking a step down. The move
can be protected with small gear. After the step-around comes an
awkward crux move in order to get your right foot into a diagonal crack, with
a solid right hand but a sketchy left foot. The initial position is sort of
like the Winnie the Pooh story where Pooh gets his head stuck in
Rabbit's burrow.  Shorter leaders will have to do a little scooching
to get to the good hold. It's important to place pro immediately
before this move (red BD hex) in order to avoid the risk of a fall that hits a
boulder below.  Once you start squirming into position,
you can also reach forward to place another piece (a 4" cam works best,
but decent 2" or 3" placements exist).  Follow the crack, which
immediately widens and becomes off width.  The climbing soon becomes
easier, leading to a big, comfy, shady belay ledge at a mountain
mahogany. 5.6

\pitch{5} This pitch involves escaping and surmounting the big
left-facing dihedral by going around to the right and getting up onto
a ramp of slab that separates the area above Lunch Ledge from Open
Book. Climb class 4 blocks to an optional belay, which helps to avoid
rope drag. Traverse all the
way right to the arete above Open Book. A white tricam in the right
orientation can be made to fit in a tiny pin scar along the way,
providing at least psychological pro. Run-out 5.0 slab climbing along
the arete leads toward a crack. A single 5.5 move is required in order
to reach a good hold and place gear (0.75-2" cam).  Continue up a
low-angle fist crack, 5.0. Natural anchor at a boulder.   55 m

<% climb("Left Ski Track","5.5",stars:1) %>

\topo{0.35}{left_ski_track}

Steep face climbing on juggy holds. 
This short south-facing route is a good moderate climb to do in early or late season.
Pro to 3", with a 4" cam helpful. Bring an absurd number of double-length slings, both for slinging natural
protection and because the first pitch zigzags. FA Chuck Wilts and Ray Van Aken, 1947.

From Lunch Rock, take the use trail around the west end of the rock.
Go past the huge dihedral of Open Book. Identify the big pine tree that
is the start of the climb. Go up the trail until you're at the same height
as the top of the tree, then traverse through a grove of manzanitas and
come down to the tree's base.

\pitch{1} From the tree, traverse left across slab under a ledge that
provides secure hands. Come back to the right along the ledge. From here the goal is
to insert into the left ski track, while locating the scarce pro;
a shallow diagonal crack has one placement that works with a pink tricam.
The cruxy move into the crack can also be protected with a black tricam before
the move and possibly a small cam in one of the pin scars on the other side.

The middle section of the pitch is fun climbing on jugs. Moving to the right
sometimes gives easier climbing at the expense of less pro.

Near the top of this pitch, the challenge is to
find some appropriate pro for the traverse left to the anchor.
If you're climbing out to the right of the crack, you may be able to find a placement for a 3" cam in a pocket, or
sling a horn. The path of least resistance to the anchor passes over an unattached
block with an asymmetrical shape like a hand with a finger pointing down.
This block seems to have withstood being pulled on somewhat and stood on
top of by climbers over the years. It's then possible to go up higher than the
anchor to the top of a triangular flake, wedge yourself and scoot down the flake to the anchor.
A 4" cam is handy either before or after gaining the flake.
35 m, 5.5

\variation{1} 
Protect with a 2-inch cam behind the pointing-hand
block and then traverse left under the ledge. Pockets for feet make the footing much better than you
would think based on the view from underneath. Reach for thin holds on top (easier for taller leaders). A fall would
be a nasty pendulum, and I've always worried
that taking a fall on the cam could pry the block out.
5.6

\pitch{2} Move back up the diagonal flake and get back in the left ski track.
During some of this section of the pitch, the feet are poor, but the hands are good.
There is a finger of rock that seems solidly attached at the bottom. Past the finger's tip, the crack disappears,
and you approach a series of aretes that you need to step around.

The first
arete is marked visually by a shallow diagonal crack at head level. 
The step around it is difficult for the grade, and the leader should take
care to protect this move for the follower (see more below). After initially committing
to this balancey no-hands move, there is a second committing move needed in order
to complete the step-around. After doing the first part, feel around with your
right hand for helpful thin holds at knee level. Completing these moves
leads to a tiny sloping ledge, and then you can step up to a second, more secure tiny
ledge, which is a little pedestal. From this stance, reach back and place pro
for the follower; a 0.4-0.5" SLCD can be placed high up. 

You are now at the left shoulder of a wine bottle, whose neck is a short second arete.
This arete superficially looks like the tall third one, including the crack on the left
(although it's 3" rather than OW).
Don't make the mistake of belaying here and climbing the neck of the wine
bottle.

Step around to
a big belay ledge behind the right shoulder. Tricams and a couple of
large SLCDs are helpful for building this anchor. 30 m, 5.6

\pitch{3} Above the belay is an arete with an off-width crack to its left.
Climb the arete and place pro in the crack. Easy climbing on the arete ends at some
slabs, where there is a bolt. Two cruxy friction moves going past the bolt are difficult for
the grade. Follow a long third-class ledge to
the left, then top out at a small tree.

\variation{2} Climb the arete until an easy opportunity arises to move right.

The 1952 FA of The Long Climb, by Royal Robbins and Don Wilson, started in the right-hand crack and
then moved over to the left-hand one, but these days almost everyone does the
first pitch using the left-hand crack. That's the only version I've done, so that's
what I describe here. Beware of loose rocks on P3, 5, and 6. 
Pro to 3".
Approach either from Lunch Rock or by taking the
North Gully trail and then backtracking along the bottom of the rock.

\pitch{1} Climb a hand and fist crack with pro on the right wall.
Belay at a ledge with an anchor consisting of chains attached with one piton and
one bolt. This variation is the Wong Climb. 5.8, 40 m

\variation{1} Climb the right-hand crack, 5.5. This is the original Long Climb route.

\pitch{2} The Mummy Crack is too wide for thigh jams. Depending on what body position you prefer, you may or may not
want to take off your pack and hang it from your waist. Pro is in a crack running
up the right wall. At the top, the right wall bends away from the vertical,
leading to a claustrophobic alcove with a roof. Squirm out of the alcove on
the left where a good right-hand hold makes the move less dire than it appears.
Belay on the right edge of the giant, sloping ledge. 5.8, 40 m

\variation{2} Climb the right-hand crack, which is the Wong Climb. Vogel describes
this as a ``rather unpleasant squeeze 5.8 chimney with loose chockstones.''

\pitch{3} If you're belaying at the natural spot immediately above the final
overhanging move of P2, then there is an obvious ramp system right above you,
but the easier climbing is actually the crack a little farther to the right.
Climb this, then make a delicate step-around move to insert into the main
crack. Higher up, the crack disappears. Head left into nondescript staircase terrain
and belay at a ledge above a large dead tree. 5.7, 40 m

\pitch{4} For the best pro, immediately head back up and right over a blocky wall,
inserting into a crack that leads to a tall pine tree.  If you want to avoid the loose
rock on the upper pitches, a good option is to exit here onto White Maiden's
Walkaway. 5.6, 20 m

\variation{3} Climb slab straight up from the belay, then head right, 5.6R.
This is the original route.

\pitch{5} From the pine tree, a feature in the shape of a bas-relief gun is easily
visible. The route continues up the steep, polished slab on the left edge of this feature. The crux consists
of transitioning onto this slab and reaching up for a hold in a crack that opens up at the left edge of
the ``gun.'' This crack is at first finger width, but then a few inches higher becomes a more secure hand jam.
The crux can be protected with small cams under the overlap below and to the left, and also with small
gear in the crack. Continue up easy terrain to a belay at a ledge system to the right. Beware of
loose blocks. 5.8, 40 m

\variation{4} Bypass the entire gun/overlap system on slabs on the left. This is the version
described in the Vogel-Gaines guidebook, but not in Gaines' Best Climbs. 5.8.

\pitch{6} Climb 3rd class terrain to the top.

\topo{0.45}{north_buttress}

This route doesn't seem to get much traffic, possibly because it has
a lot of loose rock on P1 and P4, and because P4 is wildly different in difficulty.  Gear to 3".
FA R.~Smith and Don Wilson, 1952.

Approach: The North Buttres lies
in between the Maiden Buttress and the Northeast Buttress. A gully, the start
of The Uneventful, splits the buttress at the bottom into two sub-buttresses.
The climb starts at the base of the right-hand one.
To reach the first belay in one rope length, it's necessary to start on top of a boulder.

\pitch{1} Climb a series of flakes up and left, staying on the top of the buttress.
Finish at the upper pine tree. 5.4, 60 m

\variation{1} Climb a right-facing dihedral. To avoid harder and sketchier climbing, escape left
after a while. See a beta photo on Mountainproject by JJ Klingler. 5.5

\pitch{2} Climb a crack, 5.5, that runs along the left wall of an alcove. Continue up
easy terrain to a belay ledge. 55 m

\variation{2} An off-width crack to the right.

\variation{3} A fun hand crack to the left. 

\pitch{3} Continue up nondescript terrain to a big ledge with a small pine tree and a stump.
This ledge connects to The Error on the right.
Picking a line too far to the left creates difficulties with getting over to the ledge, and
with using up the rope. 50-60 m

\pitch{4} Two right-facing dihedrals extend up to overhangs breached by two notches, both of which go.
For the best compromise between rock quality and difficulty,
start in the straight right-hand dihedral, which fades out. Continue straight up until it reappears.
The upper dihedral initially has some pro and holds, on the face, on the arete, and
up on the slab above. Place pro here and escape onto the slab. (Continuing straight up
is 5.8 PG13, requiring that you move back and forth between the arete and wide stemming
on features out to the right.) Once out on the slab, do a fingertip traverse along a crack,
then head up through the left-hand notch. 5.6, 30 m

\variation{4} Climb the left dihedral.
Exit the overhang through the left notch. This variation is easier to figure out, but
there are table-sized flakes precariously perched. 5.6

\pitch{5} Move the belay to the left end of the ledge.

% The following is duplicated in The Uneventful and The Error.

\pitch{6} Climb up and left along the
lower of two diagonal cracks. Traverse left at the obvious opportune point, to a
little saddle. Downclimb slightly to insert into the dihedral; or, for more spice,
head up a thin fingertip traverse (5.6),
which can be protected with a small cam. 
Climb to a large pine in an alcove. 5.5, 60 m

\pitch{7} Escape the alcove by climbing up and left, then continue
upward through a squeeze chimney, 5.7. The spicy friction move into
the chimney can be aided with a nut (BD \#10) if desired, but placing
the nut gets in the way of freeing the move.  Move bulky gear off of
harness loops and avoid getting stuck in a low body position.  An
alternative to the chimney is a steep section on the right. After
this crux, follow a 3rd-class ledge to a pair of trees.

\variation{4} After the chimney, continue up a right-facing dihedral, then over a short
wall.

\variation{5} Before the chimney, head left to a black and white mottled slab, with underclings
and protection available along its rim. Downclimb into the right-hand exit chute of the Larks. 5.7.

\topo{0.35}{northeast_face_east}

This is a fun route that is easily protected and
can be climbed on a Saturday morning without being in a conga line. A
possible negative is that there is a certain sameness to a lot of the
climbing on pitches 2-4.

This climb is in the middle of the northeast face, to the left of the
Larks and to the right of El Grandote. A prominent inverted ``Y'' is
formed by right-facing dihedrals, and this variation heads up its
left fork. Approach via the North Side Trail. The ``Y'' is difficult to
see through the trees from the trail, but the north face lies below
the prominent gendarme at the top of the Larks, and this climb is on
the left side of that face. Sustained 5.5-5.6 climbing on pitches 2
through 5. Pro to 3", with  a 4" cam repeatedly coming in handy.
FA Don Wilson and Royal Robbins, 1954.

\somespace

\pitch{1} Climb flakes to the left of the dihedral, enter the left-facing
part of the dihedral briefly, and belay at a small ledge. Ignore the
bolts to the right, which are for the slab climb Grace Slick. 60 m,
5.3.

\pitch{2} Continue up the crack. Insert into the main right-facing part of
the dihedral and climb a wide (knee jam) crack. End at a bolted
anchor on a huge ledge. 5.5

\pitch{3} Continue up the dihedral, toeing in to a thin crack at the
corner, to a series of overlaps at the crotch of the ``Y.'' Traverse
past a small tree, then move up through 5.6 broken terrain to a
belay. The crux of the climb is at the end of this pitch and the
beginning of the next one. Vogel and Gaines describe a variation that
swings around farther to the right, but I've heard it's harder.
Higher up is an alternative belay at a tree around a corner to the
right, but this is a poor choice due to rope drag.

\pitch{4} Head up the stem of the ``Y'' toward overhangs. Stay in the
dihedral, and don't be lured off route by the fixed piton above and
to the left. Belay as close as possible to the overhangs in order to
complete the following pitch with a 60 meter rope. A fixed pin can be
backed up with 3" or 4" cams.

\pitch{5} Pull through gaps in a set of steep blocks and irregular
overhangs. The  moves are strenuous but easily protected, with big
holds. After this the climbing gets much easier for the rest of the
route. Head for a shady belay at a pine tree on a big ledge. 60 m

\pitch{6} Continue to the right up 4th class terrain to the summit ridge,
or traverse a delicate 5.3 ledge to the left for more direct
insertion into the north gully.

\topo{0.35}{northeast_farce}

It would fun if this climb was a safe, mellow 5.3, a no-stress
vertical hike, as suggested by the name and the guidebook ratings.
Unfortunately that isn't quite what it is, because P3 is more like 5.6
by modern standards, and it lacks appropriate pro. Other pitches are
either the same as El Whampo or minor variations that aren't necessarily
any easier.

The route is located on the extreme left corner of the northeast
face, at a gigantic right-facing dihedral that dominates this entire area of the
rock. This dihedral can be distinguished from the Northeast Rib dihedral to its left
because the Northeast Farce dihedral
has the distinctive El Grandote overhang immediately to its right.
FA Don Wilson and Jerry Gallwas, 1954. Gear to 3".

\somespace

\pitch{1} Head up a gully to the left of the El Grandote Arch.
A headwall is formed by a bus-sized boulder. Pass around the boulder
to the right, and belay on top of it. 5.2, 55 m

\pitch{2} Climb through bushes, then up
the humongous dihedral to a gear belay near a mountain currant bush.
Unpleasant and possibly not any easier than doing the El Whampo
variation to the right.

\pitch{3} Continue up the dihedral.
Higher up, the climbing becomes much more strenuous, 5.6, turning
into more of an off-width crack with sloper holds. A chockstone festooned with
old, UV-damaged slings seems unfortunately to be too deeply wedged and buried
now to allow the slings to be replaced. Continue to the ledge, which is the first
highly prominent one visible above the belay. A 3" or 4" cam can be placed before
starting across the ledge. Half-way across the ledge is an old fixed pin. After the
ledge fades out, continue a short distance across 5.5 slab to the El Whampo crack,
then up it to a ledge. 
Between the fixed pin and the El Whampo crack, no other protection is available,
and if the old, rusty pin were to fail, the result would be a long 90-degree pendulum
fall back into the dihedral.
(The original version of the route continues past the El Whampo crack across more
slab to a big crack, then follows a chimney up to a belay. I would not recommend this
because the chimney is full of large, very loose blocks.)

\pitch{4} Head up and slightly left toward the roof along a curved series of wavy flakes,
leading to fun, airy 5.3 climbing over the big gully.
As you near the roof, turn right and begin traversing
along a slab that is made more secure by the availability of underclings. A comfy
belay is available at a little nook inside a dihedral. 5.3

\pitch{5} Continue traversing and look for a weak spot at which to exit up through the roof. 5.6.

\variation{1} Exit up and left from the belay, 5.7. Continue up a 5.0 gully to the left, which
leads to the crest of the Northeast Rib.

\pitch{6} Climb easy 5th class terrain to a big, comfy belay at a short, squat pine tree.

\pitch{7} Two exits present themselves, and either will work. On the left is a fourth-class
gully that leads to a short, exposed easy 5th class section to get around a corner.
The exit on the right consists of class 4 ledges.

<% climb("Northeast Rib","5.6") %>

\topo{0.4}{northeast_rib}

John and Ruth Mendenhall climbed this feature in 1940, but the details of what
they did are lost in the mists of time, and later climbers have followed a
variety of lines. This description starts to the right of the rib, which
Alois Smrz tells me is what the RCS folks used to do. Easier versions are
possible if you insert from the left, a ways up the north gully.
Wilts and Vogel-Gaines describe the rib as 5.0 to 5.2.
The joke with my climbing partners was that the right-hand version was $5.0+$.

On the extreme northeast side of the rock, between the North Gully and the smooth
Northeast Face, is a corrugated rib made of
right-facing dihedrals.  This route follows some of the smaller dihedrals
in the middle.
The start of the climb is marked by a 6-foot-diameter tree
and the distinctive El Grandote overhang to the right.
Pro to 2".

\pitch{1} To  the left of the El Grandote arch is a gully with a headwall at the top
formed by a bus-sized boulder. 
Head up this gully, but
before the climbing becomes 5th class, exit left into easier climbing up a series
of ledges. A hip belay may be desirable
for one short section that is somewhat exposed. Finish on top of the bus-sized boulder.
4th class.

(Other variations are possible from the trail below belay 1, but with a 60 m rope it will
be necessary to belay at the ledge with the two pine trees.)

\pitch{2} Head up and left on class 3/4, which quickly becomes a class 5 chimney
with brush growing in it. Keep your body position high to avoid getting stuck.
A 5.6 spot can be protected. Avoid a loose chockstone but use a second, secure one. Continue to a small ledge
with a pine tree, then on through an overhang, 5.6, to a large sloping ledge. 57 m

\pitch{3} 
Continue up a dihedral. Two parallel cracks run up the dihedral,
varying from hand width to squeeze chimney. Protection and
rock quality are good, but there are lots of pine needles.
The angle varies greatly, from low-angle to
overhanging. The overhanging crux, 5.7, is at the start of the pitch, below a large bulge. It works to climb the
right-hand crack using crack technique. Near the top of the pitch, the
dihedral tapers off. Here a squeeze chimney forms a second crux, 5.6. A chicken-wing in the chimney and
a left leg over the center flake works as a way of staying high enough to keep from getting your hips stuck. After the  chimney,
exit left toward a small pine tree and then a larger one. Be extremely careful here about kicking down loose
rock on your partner. Hanging belay at the larger pine tree or above
on orange-stained slabs (small gear). 50 m, 5.6.

\variation{2}
A possible route that would circumvent the 5.7 crux is a second dihedral, to the left, which
is easily accessible by walking around a corner. An obstacle would be the need to wade through
a large currant tree. Going even farther left might work, but would lead up into an area of overhanging
bad rock that could not be climbed safely and would have to be circumvented by traversing back right.
I haven't tried this variation.

\pitch{4} Continue up the orange slabs, then bushwhack left through chinquapins over the top-center of the rib.
Continue traversing into a shady, fairy-wonderland refuge inside a giant tree. 20 m, class 4.

If you want to, it's easy to exit from here with
a short, easy scramble down to a point on the North Gully trail, just below the turn-off
below the slabs. 

\pitch{5} From a boulder next to the big tree, get back up on the rib by
stepping onto the face. Climb to a ledge. Cross the ledge to the right.
An optional belay here may reduce rope drag. Climb either a slab or a double crack
system, with adequate pro. Finish at a saddle near a jumble of boulders perched atop
the apex of the rib. 5.4

\variation{3} Rather than getting back up on the rib, climb the dihedral at the bottom of
the wall. 4th and easy 5th class, with one short 5.3 section.

\pitch{6} Bypass the car-sized boulder, passing around it on the left. Continue up a crack.
The end of the pitch is at a mountain mahogany, not far below the landmark dead tree.
Class 3, 57 m.

\variation{4} Before reaching the wall near the top of the pitch, exit left into the North
Gully.

\topo{0.5}{orange_peel}

\warn{I've only done this climb once.}

The start of this climb is just to the left of the friction descent route,
and is easy to locate because of the prow of rock with an egg shape on top.
The total length of the climb is 73 m if you end at the mountain mahogany.
Pro to 3". FA Chuck and Ellen Wilts, 1951.

\pitch{1} After going over the egg, make a traverse down and left about 20 feet toward
a small stained feature, the namesake ``orange peel.''
The traverse lacks pro and is therefore a little unnerving for both
leader and follower. The moves are relatively easy, but tripping over
your shoelaces would result in a long pendulum swing. One way to
mitigate the risk is the following. Approach the orange peel from
underneath, sling a horn, make a 5.4 move to get on top of the orange
peel, and clip the bolts. Then downclimb and clean the pro from the horn
(because otherwise the follower would be doing the traverse from
considerably higher than the pro). Once you've clipped the bolt, there is
a cruxy friction move up and to the left. Follow an easy ledge up and left.
Near the end of this ledge, in the shelf on the right, is a unique hold in
the rock like the eye of a needle, which can be used for pro. Continue
past a horizontal crack and head for a fist crack. $\sim45$ m, 5.5

This is not a recognized route at Tahquitz, and if you refer to it by this name, people won't

Pro to 3". The first pitch is easy to protect with large SLCDs, the second with small gear.

For the approach, climb the trail around the south side of the rock to the end of the
friction route (p.~\pageref{subsec:friction-descent}). Traverse across slabs to a ``V''-shaped
double tree on the friction route, and belay there.

\pitch{1} Climb a gully up from the double tree. Beginners without anchor-building skills can
belay at an oak tree, but a more comfy gear anchor can be built in a lower-angle area above
the tree, where a horizontal crack in a boulder accepts small active gear such as pink and red
tricams. 5.0, 40 m

\pitch{2} Traverse left to a ledge and then across slab. Protect with small gear. Finish at a
manzanita tree near the top of the friction route. 5.0, 40 m

<% climb("Traitor Horn","5.7PG",stars:0) %>

\topo{0.35}{traitor_horn}

Mostly 5.6 climbing, with a short and poorly protected crux. The crux is beta-dependent and
can be confusing to climb, protect, and follow. The pro for the crux is all to
the left of the actual climbing, which the follower can't see from the
belay, so make sure the follower understands what to do. If the leader does
the wrong thing with pro and routing the rope, the follower can be exposed to a crushing
pendulum fall and then left hanging in space.

The bottom pitches are shared with Jensen's Jaunt, and also intersect
with Coffin Nail and On the Road. On weekends there tend to be traffic jams where all
these climbs come together. Pro to 3". White tricam for P6.  FA J.~Smith, A.~Johnson,
and M.~Holton, 1938. FFA Roy Gorin and William Shand, 1941.

From Lunch Rock, head around to the foot of the southwest end of the
rock.  The start of the climb lies in the general area to the right of
Fingertip Traverse and to the left of the gigantic right-facing
dihedral of Open Book.  More nearby are two short right-facing walls
at about the same height as the first belay.  One of these is to
the left (first belay of Coffin Nail) and one to the right (start of
Turbo Flange).  From the trail, it is easy to identify the red-brown
stain, the kidney-shaped flake, and the crux of the climb.  Starting from the trail a little to the left of the
route, scramble up to a start at a wooded ledge.

% Descriptions of P1-3 are duplicated for Jensen's Jaunt.

\pitch{1} Climb through an oak tree and then traverse
easy terrain to a belay near an oak tree.  4th class, 20 m

\pitch{2} Climb a thin/balancey face with a cruxy spot 10' above the tree.
Head up with the goal of getting on top of the right-facing
dihedral formed by the top edge of the kidney-shaped flake. Belay at a
cramped alcove. Belaying from low down in the alcove makes it easier for the
leader to get going on the next pitch. P2 and P3 can be linked up if desired. 5.6

\pitch{3} Climb a crack that leads up and left, narrowing from fists to hands. The first moves
out of the alcove are strenuous. These are followed by an
easier stretch, then a steeper section.  Continue to the lower
left corner of the overhangs. Belay (small gear) on a spacious
slope. 5.6

\pitch{4} To the right of the belay are two horns. Climb over the first horn, not under,
where there is a loose block. Continue traversing through easier
and well protected terrain into an alcove with slightly overhanging walls. The second
horn sticks out of the right wall. The route mostly goes up the middle of the right
wall, but with some detours to the left and right. On the left side of this wall, in
the corner, is a crack that provides the only pro, but the route doesn't go up this
crack. Although the pro isn't optimal, the ``floor'' of the alcove is steep, so there isn't
really much to hit if you fall. Clip two fixed pins in the crack, and back them up with a green or purple camalot.
Use stemming to move to the right and get to the middle of the wall. The crux is to get far enough right
to get a hand on a good hold on the horn. Pull
up onto the horn and mount it like a saddle. Tiptoe back left along a ledge, with holds
above. At the middle of the wall are
good holds allowing you to escape the alcove. 
(\emph{Don't} detour further left to the back corner to place more pro. Getting back there is
more likely to make the leader fall than just completing the crux. It also leaves
the follower where they can either get stuck hanging or take a brutal pendulum swing into
the wall and \emph{then} get stuck hanging.)
Belay immediately, rather than
higher up, to avoid routefinding and rope management problems for the follower, who cannot
tell where the route goes based on where the rope runs. Route the rope as far to the right
as possible, or a fall by the follower will be a dangerous pendulum swing that then
leaves them hanging helplessly in space. 5.7PG, 35 m

\pitch{5} Move the belay up class 4 terrain to a mountain mahogany.

\pitch{6} From the mahogany, move up and right onto a slab.
On this slab, traverse all the
way right to the arete above Open Book. A white tricam in the right
orientation can be made to fit in a tiny pin scar along the way,
providing at least psychological pro. Run-out 5.0 slab climbing along
the arete leads toward a crack. A single 5.5 move is required in order
to reach a good hold and place gear (0.75-2" cam).  Continue up a
low-angle fist crack, 5.0. Natural anchor at a boulder.

\variation{1} Climb the dihedral and then insert into the 5.1 gutter above Lunch Ledge.
I haven't tried this variation, but Vogel calls it 5.7, and it's supposed to protect well.

\topo{0.3}{trough}

The Trough was the first technical route at Tahquitz,
pioneered by members of the Sierra Club's rock climbing section.
Later it served as the original definition of 5.0 on the Yosemite Decimal
Scale, and with continuing grade inflation it has now come to be
rated about 5.3. The namesake feature constitutes the second pitch,
which includes a few awkward spots that constitute the main
difficulties. 3 pitches. Gear to 3",
slings for trees. Singles of cams are enough.

\somespace

The route was first attempted as a winter ascent in November 1935.
A newsletter from a few years later\footnote{Mugelnoos No.~68, Oct.~3, 1940} says of the FA,
``Aug.~22, 1936 \ldots Jim Smith lead Bob Brinton \& Zene Jaisaitas up the Trough. Jim wrote\ldots,
`It was surprisingly wasy, a good route for beginners.' They used 1 piton.''

\somespace

Approach: From the bottom end of the parking area at Humber Park,
take the Ernie Maxwell trail and then turn left at the signpost for
the climber's trail. Climb to Lunch Rock. Continue past Lunch Rock to
the foot of Tahquitz Rock. Turn left, and crawl up through a chimney
behind a tree. Follow the ledge until it ends. The actual route is
not visible from the start, because it's around a corner to the left.

\somespace

\pitch{1} Follow a low-angle crack around the corner. Fingers and
friction initially, then off-width. You now find yourself at a large, sloping,
triangular ledge, with a VW-size boulder on the right.
Insert into the obvious trough and climb a short distance to the
top of the boulder.
Belay at a small ledge next to the top of the boulder. 5.1, 35 m

\pitch{2} Continue up the trough. The second half of this pitch contains
several moves that in many areas would probably be
considered 5.4-5.5. At a bulge, it's necessary to pass through a hips-width
gear-snagging gap, requiring some smearing. Next comes a spot with a small
mountain mahogany growing from behind a flake on the left. Either commit to
hanging from the flake by your hands, or go straight up the finger-width
crack. Eventually you get to a point where continuing up the crack system
would lead into more difficult climbing (a different climb,
Piton Pooper 5.7), and you see Pine Tree
Ledge to the right. A difficult but protectable move gets you over a
round prow and onto the ledges to the right. This move can be done
either by groveling or with a more elegant side-pull. Belay at the tree. 5.3, 55 m.

\pitch{3} Climb straight up a face a couple of feet to the right of the pine tree,
aiming for the small oak tree that is visible against the sky. It's
difficult to find gear placements here that aren't cracks behind
flakes, but it is possible to sling a series of tiny mountain mahoganies. The slope
moderates and turns into a gully. Beyond the oak tree is a short
section of easy climbing which ends at a huge pine tree. 55 meters,
5.0 and 4th.

To complete P1 with a 60 m rope, it's necessary to scramble up some
class 3 terrain to get higher in the gully.

\pitch{1} Above the start, the gully immediately splits into three
forks. The middle fork is blocked by a steep headwall.
Head up the right-hand fork, which curves around behind
the headwall. A crux is formed by an overhang consisting 
of two tongue-shaped flakes. The top tongue is firmly attached, but possibly
not the bottom one, so detour left
rather than powering through the overhang. Continue up the gully as the
climbing gets a little easier, and finish at a comfy belay below a huge,
truncated pine tree. Alternative belays exist a little lower at an oak tree and a mountain
mahogany, but these will not get you to the second belay. 5.6, 60 m

\variation{1}  Detour left to a right-facing chimney underneath an arete.
Climb the chimney, gain the crest of the arete, continue up
to a small dead log, and then make a committing friction
move to get back in the dihedral. 5.6

\pitch{2} The gully starts to dissipate, and the climbing gets easier.
5.4, 60 m

\pitch{3} Start up and then, when you get an opportunity, head over to insert into a 10 foot tall, 80 meter long, left-facing dihedral.
One fun way to do this is by following a horizontal fingertip crack to a dead currant bush, followed
by some laybacking along the dihedral. It's also possible to move up a little higher in a 1" crack and traverse
a low-angle part of the slab.
After
inserting into the dihedral, continue to a
belay either at a decent ledge, or a little higher to a cramped semi-hanging belay right below
the overhanging arch. 5.6, 50 m

\variation{2} An obvious alternative line is a shallow crack paralleling the dihedral.
As the crack becomes less defined,
the climbing becomes more difficult and leads out onto the steep face above the Larks.
A decent belay spot is available after about 40-50 m. (Anchor with a 2" cam.)
From the belay, a crack and flake system provides an exit to the right. 
Beware of possibly loose flakes. 5.8

\pitch{4} Climb a difficult 20 m section starting with an overhanging
arch.  For pro at the arch, an old fixed pin in the wall can be
backed up with a small cam (black tricam) in the overhang itself.
Continue up the dihedral to a big ledge near two distinctive
trees: one shaped like a ``J'' and one that is now a stump.
Make the belay as far as possible
to the left on the ledge. 5.6, 35 m

% The following is duplicated in North Buttress.

\pitch{5} Start from the left end of the ledge to avoid
running out of rope. Climb up and left along the
lower of two diagonal cracks. Traverse left at the obvious opportune point, to a
little saddle. Downclimb slightly to insert into the dihedral; or, for more spice,
head up a thin fingertip traverse (5.6),
which can be protected with a small cam. 
Climb to a large pine in an alcove. 5.5, 60 m

\variation{3} Above the ``J'' tree, follow a 5.5-7 chimney/dihedral.
I haven't done this version. Two good beta
photos on Mountainproject are titled ``Jog right to skip the hard dihedral''
and ``Starting the J tree pitch that looks intimidating.''
There is some helpful discussion below one of the photos.

\pitch{6} Escape the alcove by climbing up and left, then continue
upward through a squeeze chimney, 5.7. The spicy friction move into
the chimney can be aided with a nut (BD \#10) if desired, but placing
the nut gets in the way of freeing the move.  Move bulky gear off of
harness loops and avoid getting stuck in a low body position.  An
alternative to the chimney is a steep section on the right. After
this crux, follow a 3rd-class ledge to a pair of trees.

\variation{4} After the chimney, continue up a right-facing dihedral, then over a short
wall.

\variation{5} Before the chimney, head left to a black and white mottled slab, with underclings
and protection available along its rim. Downclimb into the right-hand exit chute of the Larks. 5.7.

<% climb("West Lark","5.4",stars:1) %>

\topo{0.2}{west_lark}

A low-angle ascent up a series of obvious crack systems, with straightforward
routefinding.  The few harder moves are protectable. This is a good climb if you're
looking for something that's easy but won't be mobbed on a Saturday morning. 
Beginners attracted to this climb because it's easy should keep in mind that
it's much longer than many of the easy climbs at the west end of the rock.
Pro to 2".
Doubles of 0.5-0.75" cams are helpful on the later pitches.  FA Roy Gorin,
J.~Hudson, William Dixon, and Ellen Wilts, 1954.

The first half of the climb is easily protected with nuts, but there
is the constant hazard of falling and hitting a ledge. Pitches 4 and 5
have a lot of rounded, flaring cracks and take a little more work to
protect, but there are no ledges, so a fall would be relatively
inconsequential.

The rock quality in general is fine, but not as stellar as
some at Tahquitz, so don't trust holds without thinking, and be careful of
kicking down loose rock from belay ledges.
The very top of var 2 has a lot of breadbox-size blocks that could be
deadly if dislodged.


The start lies at  the extreme right side of the north face, just to
the left of the north buttress. The gendarme and dead tree near the top are the most
visible landmarks through the treetops. Approach via the North Side Trail, going all
the way to the east side of the face,
and then take a side trail back to the west along the face of the rock.
The start can be located by looking for the distinctive arch
on the right, and the big hexagonal flake.

\somespace

\pitch{1} Head up the crack that runs along the left side of the
hexagonal flake.
Protect against falls onto the numerous ledges. 5.2,
33 m

\variation{1} Climb to the top right corner of the hexagonal flake,
then past an inconvenient bush and left a few feet across the flake.
Easier climbing, except for the friction move past the bush.

\pitch{2} Continue up similar climbing in the same crack,
ending at a set of ledges on the right.  5.2, 40 m 

\pitch{3} From the right side of the ledge, begin climbing a
different crack. A series of small mountain mahogany trees grow in the crack
and can be used for pro.
Continue up through a gap in an overhang (5.6 crux) and belay at the second ledge
above it, on top of a little buttress  (0.75" and 1" SLCDs).
(Belaying underneath the overhang makes it impossible to reach the
comfiest spot for the next belay unless you have a 70 m rope and simul the last 5 feet.)
$\sim 50$ m

\pitch{4} Continue up easy climbing with less abundant protection.  A
right-facing wall develops to the left. About 25 m up, there is an extremely
dangerous loose block shaped like a crayon, with a mahogany growing out of its
tip. If you want to split this pitch in half, the last relatively comfy semi-hanging
belay is near the base of this death crayon. After the death crayon, the dihedral grows and the
climbing gets harder. This section eats finger-width pro. Escape a headwall by climbing the easy wall to the left.
Belay at a comfy ride-em-cowboy saddle immediately above the corner
(0.5-1" active pro).
57 m

\pitch{5} 
Continue up a low-angle gutter by
toeing in, securely but somewhat painfully, to a crack.
It takes a little work to find pro. A small white fir and currant bush
can be slung. As you near the end of the pitch redirect the rope to avoid
dragging it over the currant.
Finish at a big ledge below the huge gendarme. Anchor with 1-4" cams.
5.0, 50 m

% The following is duplicated in East Lark.

\pitch{6} This easy pitch is the most fun part of the climb. Continue
straight up, on the right side of the gendarme.  
Next to it is its little sister, a rock shaped like the prow of a ship.
Between them is a chimney. Climb the steep and scary-looking chimney, which is a surprisingly
easy 5.2 and well protected.
Over all this is the easiest and safest pitch on the climb, and
makes an excellent lead for a beginner.

\variation{2} On the left side of the ledge is a wall/arete. Climb this
to a steep but well protected face that is the the lower left part of
the gendarme, where it fades out. Escape to the left at a bush and
insert into the broad chute. Pull over a protectable overhang. 5.4


\somespace

\descent Gain the summit ridge and head down left into the north gully descent route (p.~\pageref{subsec:north-gully-descent}).


%=================================================================================

<% climb("El Whampo","5.7",stars:1) %>

\topo{0.35}{el_whampo}

This route braids together with others including Northeast Farce and El Grandote.
Many variations are possible, the sweet El Whampo crack pitch being the only
naturally defining feature of this particular climb.
Variation 1 is Northeast Farce. Different guidebooks and tribal elders disagree about
which of the variations of P4 is the real route.
The climb starts at the base of the huge right-facing Northeast Farce dihedral,
at the extreme left side of the northeast face.
This diherdral can be distinguished from the Northeast Rib dihedral to its left
because the Northeast Farce has the El Grandote overhang immediately to its right.
Pro to 3". Doubles of cams 0.5-1" for the El Whampo crack.
FA Richard Coats, Larry Reynolds, D.~McLean, and D.~Ross, 1964.

\somespace

\pitch{1} Head up a gully to the left of the El Grandote Arch.
A headwall is formed by a bus-sized boulder. Pass around the boulder
to the right, and belay on top of it. 5.2, 55 m

\pitch{2} Climb a thin crack and then move left into the dihedral at one of two ledges.
The first ledge is easier.
Follow the dihedral to a gear belay near a mountain currant bush.
5.7, 40 m

\variation{1} Climb through bushes, then up the dihedral.  Unpleasant
and possibly not any easier than doing the El Whampo version.

\pitch{3} Traverse right across slab. Protect with a \#2 (yellow) Metolius TCU under a cubical prow.
Go to the second finger crack.
A difficult move is required in order to start up the crack.
To protect this move, use small pro such as BD \#5 nuts or a black Totem.
After this move, the rest of the pitch is much easier.
Follow a diagonal crack that connects to the actual El Whampo crack.
As you continue up the crack, it thins from fists to fingers. A 2" cam is helpful
for the anchor. 5.7, 45 m

\pitch{4} Head up and slightly left toward the roof along a curved series of wavy flakes,
leading to fun, airy 5.3 climbing over the big gully.
As you near the roof, turn right and begin traversing
along a slab that is made more secure by underclings. A comfy
belay is available at a little nook inside a dihedral. 5.3.

% ... This is the version described in Wilts 5th ed. Gaines Best Climbs calls this "left variation" and implies it's the default.

\variation{2} Head more directly toward the belay.  5.7 PG.

% ... This is the version described in Vogel-Gaines 3rd ed. However, in Best Climbs he describes this as "right variation"
%     and calls it 5.7 PG/R.

\variation{3} Traverse an undercling, protecting with cams, then insert into the El Dorado trough. (Reputed to
be better protected than var 2. I haven't tried this one.)

\variation{4} Escape the arch early. I haven't tried this variation.

% ... Vogel-Gaines says this is part of El Grandote, but Gaines Best Climbs describes the two climbs as being the same and not doing this.

\pitch{5-7} Escape up and left through a gap in the roof above the belay. The gap is awkwardly
slanting wide fists with difficult feet, but you can protect it well with cams.
Continue up a gully, which forks into a gully on the left and a right-facing
dihedral to the right. Climb 4th-class terrain up the left and get on the Northeast Rib route.
Continue on the 3rd-class crest of the rib all the way to the top (near a dead tree), or exit early into the
northeast gully.

\variation{5} Layback the dihedral to the right. Hanging belay. Continue up two more
pitches. Climb slab to a big, comfy belay at a short, squat pine tree.
After this, two exits present themselves, and either will work. On the left is a fourth-class
gully that leads to a short, exposed easy 5th class section to get around a corner.
The exit on the right consists of class 4 ledges.

\variation{6} Take an easier exit farther to the right and finish on Northeast Farce.

<% climb("White Maiden's Walkway","5.4",stars:3) %>

\topo{0.35}{maiden}

\warn{I haven't done var 6.}

A Tahquitz classic. Difficult routefinding.
Mostly 5.0 to 5.3, but a few 5.6 moves are required.
Start from the left side of the Maiden Buttress, which can be
approached either from the North Side Trail or the Lunch Rock Trail.
Pro to 3", or 4" for variations 2 and 3.
FA Jim Smith and Arthur Johnson, Aug.~14, 1937.

\pitch{1} Start near the highest tree in the crook of
the buttress. Hand jam to get onto a series of flakes.
Traverse toward a ledge with a big pine tree, then up and left
to a ledge with a mahogany and a currant. (Or, for easier climbing,
detour farther right to an inobvious ledge.)

\variation{1} Start at the more visually obvious spot, at the bottom of
a gully. The first move is a difficult mantle, worth protecting.
After the first pine tree, enter a gutter heading up
and to the left, but then immediately exit the gutter to the right to
avoid getting the rope snagged in brush. Continue past the big pine tree.

\variation{2} Start in the square alcove at the center of the buttress. Climb over
car-sized flakes. Belay at a large wooded ledge. Mostly 5.0-5.4, with a few harder moves, including one near the start.
3-4" cams are helpful.

\pitch{2} Traverse to the right, under the branches of the currant and then over a saddle behind a car-sized chickenhead.
From the saddle, lean over to place pro in a 1" crack.
Downclimb a few feet to a stemming stance and then come back up to the crack. (It's also possible to
stand on a rock and step straight across, but this is easier for taller leaders.)
Finish traversing the slab and  insert into a gutter, which magically becomes 5.0 if you grope and find the invisible
undercling crack. Watch for an exit to a large saddle
on the right. A common mistake is to overshoot the saddle instead of
exiting. 35 meters

\variation{3} A clean straight-in hand and foot crack just left of the mahogany. 5.7

\variation{4} An unpleasant ragged fist- and off-width crack
starting from the currant tree.
A fall near the start risks impalement on a dead tree. 5.6

\pitch{3} From the center of the saddle, head straight up toward a
waist-high white fir. Near the second fixed pin, you run out of easy ways up, the
only apparent option being a very difficult mantling move up to a
small sloper hold. Instead, grope for a series of excellent holds that allow
you to easily move up and to the right. Come back to a ledge containing 
a large prostrate oak tree and a smaller mountain mahogany. Place
gear to route the rope so as to avoid damaging the mahogany by dragging
the rope over it. 5.4, 35 meters

\pitch{4} Climb 15 meters up a 5.3 flake/arete. As the flake levels out and
disappears, your left hand lands on a large, loose conch-shaped block,
and there is a second block farther to the left. Walk across the two
blocks and make a committing step around a corner to a stemming stance
underneath a small tree. The stance can be stabilized with a hand in a
finger-width crack on the right. Get on top of the tree and then head
up a 5.0 gully. Belay at a big ledge with two mountain mahoganies. 58 meters

\pitch{5} From a spot on the ledge just to the left of the right-hand tree, head up
into a right-facing dihedral.  Before getting too close to the ceiling, traverse right
along 3rd-class ledges and flakes.  Gear belay in a one-inch
crack in a right-facing dihedral in the big gully. Class 3.

% The following is duplicated in Fools Rush, with different pitch and variation numbers.

\pitch{6} For the standard 5.3 finish, head 10 feet up the one-inch crack,
then exit into a cave formed by a claustrophobic overhang.
Escape the cave by moving out onto a slab, approaching
a wall that gets in the way. Mantle over the wall as far to the
right as possible. 

\variation{5} Head straight up through gaps in the overhangs above
the belay. The crux is the awkward second gap, 5.8.

% Var. 5, the 5.1, is shown on the topo but not described in the text.

\section{Emergency Rappels}\label{sec:raps}

\subsection{General Information}

All the climbs described in this book go up and over, with a walk off the back.
It's not normal to rappel back down these routes, and doing so will be difficult
and extremely time-consuming, and will usually involve leaving gear. Retreat will
be especially difficult on the north side or from high up on the rock. The information
about rappel routes on pp.~\pageref{sec:raps}-\pageref{subsec:rap-lunch-ledge} is provided
here so that in an emergency such as a severe injury, climbers will have some help in
evaluating their options. In a serious emergency, it may be a better option to call
911. Riverside Mountain Rescue Unit does technical rescues on the rock.

If you are going
to rappel off of trees, do not trust old nylon slings left behind by other people.
Back them up with your own cord. Two people were killed in 2022 when they rapped off
of old tat in this area. Because this is not an area where people routinely
rappel, a sling on a tree may just be left over from when someone put it there a decade ago,
and may not have been used since then.
